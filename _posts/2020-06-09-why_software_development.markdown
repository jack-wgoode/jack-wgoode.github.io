Deciding to change course is a difficult decision. Even when it is painfully obvious that you are unfulfilled and 
frustrated in your current path. Why do we stay on those paths and complete a "default career" that we can only 
explain we "landed in"? 

I approached the path of a career change into software development as early as 1999. The resources were much more 
limited than they are today. Finding a way to translate the Computer Science degree that I started earning into real employment was hard when I already had a career and I had a family counting on me. I hoped to make a change within the insurance company where I worked as an adjuster but my plans took a hard left when they laid off 35 developers and outsourced that department.I took an offer to go into technology sales and shelved the dream.

```
"What if I can't do this?  Is it too late? 
```

Fast-forward to 2020, 20 years later. I am a field sales executive caught in a COVID-19 Pandemic and not able to travel. I find out about Career Karma and the tremendous resources and community ready to support those who want to enter tech. I find out that Bootcamps that are connected with employers are more flexible than ever. I had time to ask myself what I could create to contribute something lasting to others. I took each step closer and grew more excited to know it was possible. I am in the "First Mile" of bootcamp and bouncing between confident and way out of my comfort zone. It is hard but I have the support and determination to go from understanding how lines of code make things happen to eventually building apps that make even greater things happen. 

Did I make the right decision? When I see apps start and support a movement when people are hurting in the wake of
the events following George Floyd's death, I know I did. I am on a path to build technology that will enable and connect *people* to care for each other.

No matter how successful you are in your current career, what are you building? That question is changing my life.
