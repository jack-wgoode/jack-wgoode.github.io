## Can I really do this? 

As I approach my first milestone project at Flatiron Bootcamp I feel strange mix of confidence and apprehension.This is what I signed up for. It was important to me that my bootcamp prepared me for life in the real world of developers. Sometimes...OK! Often this means having more questions than answers but having a process for finding the resource that you need. Up until this point, I have been learning the pieces and coding with test defined for me. Now it is time to put that into practice and learn how to bring it all together.

At his point, I have a very general knowledge of an API and I am really excited about learning more. the "CLI" simply describes a "command line interface". In other words, the user will type in the terminal and get the results as text. 
So it is time for me to jump in and start coding so that we can do this done, right? Actually we first need a clear map of what we are trying to do. I am beginning with a flow chart mapping out what the user needs to do to start the program and the results of their choices on the output. I considered what classes I would define to create objects that represented all the pieces of my project. Seeing more shelter and rescue animals adopted is close to my heart so I will be using the Yelp Fusion API to allow a user to choose a location and receive a list of the closest animal shelters where they may be able to volunteer or adopt. They will also be able to get more details about any of the shelters on the list or do more than one location search before they exit.

So yes we have an alphabet soup of acronyms and a lot of questions but I plan to gain a powerful grasp on how to use any API and be able to contribute my own Gem to the Ruby community after all this is done. I also plan to build my experience in pair programming and team support. 

Barely more than a month ago I was starting the fundamentals of coding. When I see how far I have come I am both humbled by how much I have to learn and confident that yes, I can do this.I look forward to sharing the results.
